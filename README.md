# COVID-19-Pandemic-and-VIX

## Summary
This project aims to investigate which COVID-19-related data (e.g., US infection mortality rate, confirmed cases in supply chain countries, etc.) are most correlated with the investor panic index, particularly the VIX. It explores whether COVID-19 data can serve as a basis for predicting the panic index.

## Motivation
Many media outlets and investors attributed the 2020 US stock market crash to the outbreak of COVID-19. In 2020, numerous media outlets expressed concerns and panic about future US stock prices. This study aims to verify the correlation between the outbreak of COVID-19 and market concerns and panic regarding US stock prices. Investor panic about future stock prices can be inferred from the level of the VIX index. When the VIX value is high, it indicates that investors expect significant fluctuations in the future S&P500 stock index. Therefore, we choose to use the VIX index as a substitute variable for panic level. There are various aspects and types of COVID-19-related data, and determining which data are suitable as evaluation criteria and how to optimize regression are also subjects of investigation in this project.

## Details
* Programming Language: R

## Approach
1. Collect COVID-19-related data such as mortality rates, infection rates, and economic indicators.
2. Obtain VIX index data as an indicator of investor panic.
3. Analyze the correlation between COVID-19 data and the VIX index.
4. Explore regression models to predict the VIX index based on COVID-19 data.
5. Optimize the regression model for better prediction accuracy.

## Goals
* Identify the COVID-19 data most correlated with investor panic.
* Determine whether COVID-19 data can reliably predict investor panic as indicated by the VIX index.
* Provide insights into the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and market sentiment.
